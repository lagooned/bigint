Hi! Thanks for looking at my program. A few things to note:

+ I renamed BigIntegerTest.cpp -> BigIntTest.cpp to be slightly more consistent
    with naming.
+ Just running 'make' from bash should compile everything needed, however if it
    doesn't, running 'make BigIntTest' and 'make MyTest' separately should also
    work.

Thanks. :D
